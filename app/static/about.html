          <h1>Who am I?</h1>
          <p>My name is Simon Batardiere, and I'm a very curious guy who like to learn new things. I discovered Ethereum technology in May 2016, and was very excitting by it. There are so many new, fun and usefull things to develop and deploy on the network. I would like to participate to this small revolution, and just add my little brick on this system. I learnt solidity and web technology by myself to be able to acheive this project. The goal of this project is to learn a lot of new thing for me, and bring a little service to the community, even if this is not the most usefull service!</p>
          <p>Else I am a french software and network engineer, even if I am most familiar with language C and embedded Linux Kernel than Web technologies.</p>
          <h1>What is Ethereum?</h1>
          <p>Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.</p>
          <p>These apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.</p>
          <p>Please find more information about Ethereum on the <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">official website</a>.</p>
